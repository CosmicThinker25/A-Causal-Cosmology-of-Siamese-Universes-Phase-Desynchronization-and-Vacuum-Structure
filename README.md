# A Causal Cosmological Framework for Siamese Universes

This project presents a short essay introducing the idea of “Siamese Universes”: two mirror universes
that share a common quantum vacuum and generate matter and structure when a tiny phase
desynchronization makes that shared vacuum fertile.

The text explains how this small loss of synchrony can lead to density variations, imperfect
baryogenesis, the formation of stars and black holes, and possible large-scale anisotropies. It also
connects the idea with known concepts such as CPT symmetry, vacuum structure, and minimal
geometric coupling.

The same essay is provided here as two PDF files: one in English and one in Spanish.
